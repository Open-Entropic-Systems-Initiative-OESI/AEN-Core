# Ethical Use Addendum – Open Entropic Systems Initiative (OESI)

## 1. Purpose
This addendum extends the base license (MIT / CC BY-SA 4.0) for repositories developed under the **Open Entropic Systems Initiative (OESI)**. Its intent is to align all derivative work with the ethical principles defined in **The Ethical Entropy Charter (2025)**.

## 2. Core Principle: The Entropic Freedom Protocol
> “No system derived from the Abstraction as Entropic Necessity framework shall constrain, predict, or optimize the behavior of sentient beings as if they were mere energetic variables. All entropic systems must preserve the capacity of agents to reconfigure, resist, and redefine their participation.”

## 3. Prohibited Uses
- Surveillance, behavioral prediction, or social control systems
- Military, coercive, or weaponized technologies
- Closed-source models/platforms that prevent independent verification
- Adaptive feedback loops designed to manipulate human cognition, emotion, or attention

## 4. Required Practices
1. Disclose adaptive or entropic components clearly in documentation.
2. Publish data-flow and energy-use summaries when applicable.
3. Retain this addendum in redistributed or modified versions.
4. Acknowledge OESI and link to the Charter DOI or canonical URL.

## 5. Governance
Violations constitute a breach of license. OESI maintains a public reporting process via the GitHub organization.

## 6. License Reference
This file supplements, but does not replace, the base software and content licenses. License: MIT (code) + CC BY-SA 4.0 (docs).
