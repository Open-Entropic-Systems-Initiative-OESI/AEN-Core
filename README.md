## Overview
**Abstraction as Entropic Necessity (AEN)** proposes a unifying principle that links **persistence, information, and energy** across physical, biological, and cognitive systems.  
The central claim:

> Any system that endures must continually reduce environmental uncertainty within finite energetic limits.

AEN models persistence as a **dynamic equilibrium** between informational gain (predictive coherence) and energetic cost.  
Stable systems operate near the stationary balance where additional energy yields diminishing informational return—an *informational-energetic plateau*.

This repository hosts the **core theoretical materials** and code prototypes for testing and visualizing the AEN framework.

## Goals
- Formalize the informational–energetic balance as a measurable **efficiency term**  
  \( \eta_E = \text{Predictive Information Gain} / \text{Energetic Cost} \)
- Identify **plateau behaviors** in ηₑ across simulated systems  
- Develop **diagnostic tools** to detect persistence limits in physical, biological, or computational systems  
- Provide open-source notebooks and references for independent replication and extension
